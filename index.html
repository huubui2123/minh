    <h1 style="color:blue;">How to build a budget PC</h1>
    <p>Today I will try my best to max out the performance,<br>for your PC with under $1,000.</p>
    <hr>
    
    <h2 style="color:blue;">CPU</h2>
    <p>The "brain" of your PC.</p>
    <p>Intel core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 would be a great option.</p>
    <hr>
    
    <h2 style="color:blue;">GPU</h2>
    <p>The "heart" of your PC.</p>
    <p>The second most imortant part of a PC.</p>
    <p>I recommend the Radeon RX 580 8GB DDR5 from AMD,this card is as strong as a GTX1060 6GB<br>but much cheaper.</p>
    <hr>
    
    <h2 style="color:blue;">RAM</h2>
    <p>The memory for our CPU, which is very important too.</p>
    <p>Make sure to have at least 8GB of RAM, DDR4 of course.</p>
    <hr>
    
    <h2 style="color:blue;">Motherboard</h2>
    <p>The "skeleton" of your very own PC.</p>
    <p>This one is dependent on which CPU are you planning to go for.</p>
    <hr>
    
    <h2 style="color:blue;">Power supply</h2>
    <p>This one is also dependent on the other parts, I suggest you pick this at your last item.</p>
    <hr>
    
    <h2 style="color:blue;">Storage</h2>
    <p>At least 1TB of HDD for your data and 120GB of SSD for Windowns install.</p>
    <hr>
    
    <h2 style="color:blue;">Case</h2>
    <p>There is a wide variety of cases for you to chose, pick wisely.</p>
